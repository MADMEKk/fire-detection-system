# üî• Real-Time Fire Detection System

A sophisticated fire detection system using computer vision and a community-driven verification approach to detect and verify fire incidents in real-time.

## üåü Features

### 1. Fire Detection
- Real-time fire and smoke detection using YOLO model
- Confidence-based detection (threshold: 50%)
- Automatic image annotation showing detection boxes
- Support for both Raspberry Pi camera and laptop webcam

### 2. Three-Wave Verification System
1. **First Wave (30s)**
   - Sends alerts to 5 random rookie/guardian users
   - Moves to second wave if no response in 30s

2. **Second Wave (30s)**
   - Sends to 5 new random rookie/guardian users
   - Escalates to final wave if no response in 30s

3. **Final Wave**
   - Sends to all expert/master ranked users
   - Higher verification priority and points

### 3. User Ranking System
- **Rookie**: New users (0-499 points)
- **Guardian**: Regular users (500-999 points)
- **Expert**: Experienced users (1000-1999 points)
- **Master**: Elite users (2000+ points)

### 4. Points System
- Base points per verification:
  - Regular users: 10 points
  - Ranked users (Expert/Master): 20 points
- Speed bonus: Up to 30 points based on response time
- Alert verification requires 3 votes
- Alert confirmed if 2+ votes are positive

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Backend (Django)
- Django REST Framework for API
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication and permission system
- Real-time alert processing
- User management and ranking system

### Fire Detection
- YOLO model (fire_s.pt) for detection
- OpenCV for image processing
- Support for multiple camera types
- Real-time image annotation

### Simulation Tools
1. **Camera Simulator** (`camera_simulator.py`)
   - Uses laptop webcam for testing
   - Real-time fire detection
   - Automatic alert generation

2. **User Simulator** (`user_simulator.py`)
   - Simulates user behavior with different ranks
   - Realistic response times based on rank
   - Automatic verification decisions
   - Multi-threaded user simulation

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Run simulations:
   ```bash
   cd simulation
   ./run_simulation.sh
   ```
